Australians’ support for Indigenous voice steady with 60% in favour, Essential poll finds
Public support for the Indigenous voice to parliament is holding steady and remains high, the latest Guardian Essential poll shows, in contrast with other recent polls suggesting that support is sliding. The poll of 1,123 voters, published on Tuesday, found 60% of respondents were in favour of the voice, up one point on the previous survey, while 40% were opposed to it. The yes vote still leads in all major opinion polls, but voice supporters and senior Labor government figures have raised concerns about the vigour of the yes campaign as the no campaign grows in volume. A Resolve poll for the Nine newspapers, published on Monday, showed 42% in favour and 40% against with 18% undecided – but when forced to make a yes or no decision only 49% supported the change while 51% opposed it. Last week’s Newspoll showed 46% support, 43% against and 11% undecided. The psephologist Kevin Bonham calculates average support to be in the mid-50s, after Resolve and Newspoll recorded the biggest declines for the yes vote. But the Essential poll is more optimistic for the voice, with support steady at 59% or 60% in the past four polls.
