Silvio Berlusconi, scandal-ridden former Italian prime minister, dies aged 86
Allies and critics have paid tribute to the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the countryâ€™s longest-serving postwar leader and one of its most divisive, who has died aged 86. The billionaire media tycoon and former AC Milan owner who entered politics at the head of his own Forza Italia in the 1990s as the traditional parties of the right collapsed led three governments between 1994 and 2011 and succeeded in making a comeback in 2017 despite a career tainted by sex scandals, allegations of corruption and a tax fraud conviction. He died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, where he had spent six weeks this spring undergoing treatment for a lung infection linked to a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia before being readmitted.
